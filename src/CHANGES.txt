TracGoogleAppsAuthPlugin Changelog
==================================

0.3.2 - 2011-XX-XX
------------------

* l10n by The Translation Project <http://translationproject.org> into
  the following languages:
    - Esperanto [eo]
    - Finnish [fi]
    - Russian [ru]
    - Ukrainian [uk]
    - Chinese (simplified) [zh_CN]


0.3.1 - 2011-03-03
------------------

* Bugfix to ensure locale/ directory is included in source distribution


0.3.0 - 2010-12-07
------------------

* Automatically encrypt the stored Google Apps password (config value
  'admin_secret') to protect against casual observation on the filesystem
  or the web interface. Note that the encryption is trivial and is meant
  only to prevent making it easily displayed to "friendly" sources.
  
* i18n support, see: http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/CookBook/PluginL10N

* Rename Python package from `createtank.trac.googleauth` to simply
  `googleappsauth`.


0.2.3 - 2010-12-03
------------------

* Insert users' names and email addresses into Trac DB on call to `get_users`
  (when loading the user listing page) so that notifications can be sent
  out to users who may not have configured their preferences yet


0.2.2 - 2010-12-02
------------------

* Fix bug to ensure that only members of Google Apps group configured for
  'group_access' may log in.

* List libraries dependencies on the "About Trac" page


0.2.1 - 2010-12-01
------------------

* Bug fix: Ensure users may only log in with username, not email address


0.2.0 - 2010-11-30
------------------

* Added 'group_access' config option for restricting domain users to Google
  Apps group membership.

* Flush a user's cached groups upon login (so that newly adding a user to a
  group will be quickly reflected in Trac by a logout/login).


0.1.1 - 2010-11-29
------------------

* Minor bug fixes and packaging updates


0.1.0 - 2010-11-27
------------------

* Initial alpha release with basic auth features.
